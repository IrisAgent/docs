## **Introduction**

\
IrisAgent provides AI-powered answers to support tickets from internal knowledge base in Confluence using the Atlassian Confluence integration.

## **Connect with Atlassian**

1. Login to the [IrisAgent dashboard](https://web.irisagent.com/). This step assumes that you have already connected IrisAgent to your ticketing provider.
2. Click on **Manage Integrations** option on the bottom left menu.
3. If you are using Atlassian cloud instance, click on **Connect with Atlassian/Jira Cloud**. Else, if you are using Atlassian on-prem instance, click on **Connect with Atlassian/Jira Server**. Give the OAuth permissions and click on Allow. This will automatically connect IrisAgent with Jira and Confluence.

   <br />

- If you are connecting with Atlassian Cloud, a follow-on page will show up that asks for the Atlassian cloud token, email address, and base URL. Here are [the steps to create the token](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/).
- If you are connecting with Atlassian Server, a follow-on page will show up that asks for the Atlassian server token and base URL. Here are [the steps to create the token](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/).

## Selecting certain Confluence Spaces 

1. When creating the token in the step above, ensure you only give permissions to the relevant projects.
2. After you connect with your Atlassian account, the Atlassian tile on the "Manage Integrations" page should as connected. Click on the Settings gear icon. This is show a side panel where you can select/deselect which projects you want IrisAgent to have access to.

## **Details on IrisAgent's Atlassian Connection**

IrisAgent only ingests data from Atlassian from the last 3 months (can be configured). It make POST and GET API calls to fetch data while ensuring that the Atlassian's rate limits are not exceeded. The frequency of API call can be configured based on customer's preference.

### **Permissions of the Atlassian Token**

The Atlassian token generated by a user has the same access level as that user’s permissions within jira. It is recommended that a service user be created and that user’s token be entered in the IrisAgent dashboard, so that permissions can be easily granted/revoked as and when new functionality is introduced.

### **OAuth permissions needed for Confluence**

IrisAgent uses this integration to automatically suggest articles and resolutions from Confluence that match a new support case and assist both support reps and customers in finding faster resolutions. The token needs to have the following permissions in Confluence:

1. Read all blogs
2. Read all pages

### **Granting Access only to either Jira/Confluence**

1. Create a service user who has access only to the feature you want to use. E.g. : A service user with access restricted only to Confluence.
2. If the service user has access to one of Jira/conlfluence, please ensure that all permissions required within that section are met.
3. Generate a token for this service user and follow the same connection procedure by visiting the “Manage Integrations” section as mentioned above.s
