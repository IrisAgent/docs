## Install the IrisAgent app into your Jira account

1. Navigate to [IrisAgent's listing](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1229507/irisagent?tab=overview&hosting=cloud) on the Atlassian Marketplace.
3. If you manage multiple Atlassian sites, select the Jira instance where you want to install IrisAgent from the dropdown.
4. Review the app permissions and click **Install**. You will be redirected back to your Jira instance once installation is complete.

Alternatively, you can install from within Jira:

1. In your Jira instance, click **Apps** in the top navigation bar, then select **Explore more apps**.
2. Search for **IrisAgent** in the Marketplace search bar.
3. Click on the IrisAgent listing, then click **Get app** or **Free trial**. Review the requested permissions and confirm the installation.

## **Enable the app for team members**

- Once the IrisAgent app is installed on your Jira site, it is enabled for all users by default.
- To verify or change this, go to **Apps \> Manage apps** from the top navigation bar in Jira. Locate **IrisAgent** in the list of installed apps and ensure its status shows as **Enabled**. If it shows as Disabled, click the **Enable** button to activate it for all users.

## **Display IrisAgent on the Jira issue page**

- Once installed and enabled, the IrisAgent app adds a panel to the Jira issue view. This panel surfaces AI-generated insights, correlated issues, and recommended actions directly within each Jira issue.
- To see the panel, open any recent Jira issue and click on the hexagon icon, called **View app actions** below the issue title.
- Select **IrisAgent** from the drop down and you will see the IrisAgent app appear in the central panel above the Activity section.
