## **Details on IrisAgent's Atlassian Connection**

IrisAgent only ingests data from Atlassian from the last 3 months (can be configured). It make POST and GET API calls to fetch data while ensuring that the Atlassian's rate limits are not exceeded. The frequency of API call can be configured based on customer's preference.

### **Permissions of the Atlassian Token**

The Atlassian token generated by a user has the same access level as that user’s permissions within jira. It is recommended that a service user be created and that user’s token be entered in the IrisAgent dashboard, so that permissions can be easily granted/revoked as and when new functionality is introduced.

### **OAuth permissions needed for Jira Software**

IrisAgent uses this integration to correlate Jira Software bugs with support cases automatically, prioritize open bugs using business and support impact and provides visibility to customer support, engineering, and product management teams. The token needs to have the following permissions in Jira:

1. Read for all Jira issues (and comments). If you'd like to sign up for the **optional** trigger features to write comments and tags on Jira, please include write permissions too.
2. Read all Jira projects
3. Access to the /issue/createmeta endpoint to discover the project and issue types while creating a new Jira issue from the IrisAgent app. This is another **optional** feature to be able to create Jira issues from your ticketing system.

### **Granting Access only to either Jira/Confluence**

1. Create a service user who has access only to the feature you want to use. E.g. : A service user with access restricted only to Confluence.
2. If the service user has access to one of Jira/conlfluence, please ensure that all permissions required within that section are met.
3. Generate a token for this service user and follow the same connection procedure by visiting the “Manage Integrations” section as mentioned above.s
