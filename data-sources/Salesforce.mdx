## Share the list of custom fields

Salesforce Service Cloud allows use of many custom fields. We would need those field names to perform data ingestion. Please email the API field names for the following entities at [this email address](contact@irisagent.com):

1. Article body in Salesforce Knowledge
2. Case priority
3. Any other entity for which you are using a custom field, instead of the default standard field that you would like IrisAgent to access

Permissions accessed by IrisAgent

1. IrisAgent uses [the “api” scope](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_tokens_scopes.htm&type=5).
2. The token obtained after the OAuth flow will have access to all the objects the logged-in user has access. Hence, a separate service user should be created for IrisAgent with sufficient permissions to access the objects required by IrisAgent.
3. Below are the objects accessed by IrisAgent

```
Objects with Read permissions: CaseArticle, CaseSolution, Solution, Account, CaseTag, Contact, EmailMessage, LiveChatTranscript, User, Group, Knowledge__kav, Knowledge__DataCategorySelection
Objects with Read and Write permissions: Case, CaseComment

```


The above steps will complete the installation of IrisAgent. Please [email us](contact@irisagent.com) once these steps are completed, and our team will start setting up the machine learning models for your account.
