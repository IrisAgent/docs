## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A GoTo Connect account with admin or super admin access
- Access to the GoTo Connect PBX Administration portal
- A phone number in GoTo Connect that will receive customer calls

## Step 1: Sign Up for IrisAgent

You can sign up for IrisAgent in one of two ways: by connecting your ticketing platform or using public website as knowledge source.

## Step 2: Create a Dial Plan in GoTo Connect

Next, configure GoTo Connect to route incoming calls to your IrisAgent Voice AI.

### Access the Dial Plan Editor

1. Sign in to the GoTo Connect Admin Portal
2. Navigate to **Phone System** → **Dial Plans**
3. Click **\+ Add Dial Plan** to create a new dial plan

### Configure the Dial Plan

1. Give your dial plan a descriptive name (e.g., "IrisAgent Voice AI")
2. In the dial plan editor, add a node to route calls to an external number
3. Enter the **external phone number** provided by the IrisAgent team

4. Configure any additional routing options as needed:
   - Set business hours if you want AI to handle calls only during specific times
   - Add fallback options for when the external number is unavailable
5. Click **Save** to save your dial plan

## Step 3: Test Your Integration

After completing the setup, verify that calls are routing correctly to IrisAgent Voice AI.

### Make a Test Call

1. Call the phone number you configured from an external phone (not a GoTo Connect line)
2. You should hear the IrisAgent Voice AI greeting
3. Test a few common customer queries to ensure responses are working as expected
