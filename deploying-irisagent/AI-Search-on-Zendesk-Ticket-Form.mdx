title: "AI Search On Zendesk Ticket Form"
description: "Integrate IrisAgent AI Search into your Zendesk Ticket Submission Form to automatically suggest AI answers and reduce ticket volume"
---

A lightweight, drop-in JavaScript widget that adds AI-powered ticket deflection to your Zendesk Help Center. It listens to user input on the "Submit a Request" page and suggests relevant answers from your knowledge base before a ticket is created.

## Prerequisites

1. Admin access to your Zendesk Help Center
2. Access to IrisAgent dashboard

## Edit the Zendesk theme template

Upload your Zendesk Guide them to load the widget:

1. Log in to the Zendesk Admin Center
2. Navigate to the **Customize Design** tab in your Zendesk Help Center. This can be found under Zendesk Guide \> Guide Admin \> Customize Design.
3. Select your theme and click on **Edit code**.
4. Open `new_request_page.hbs`  (the "New request" form template) and paste the following code snippet inside the form (commonly near the bottom):

```javascript
<script
  src="https://chatbot.irisagent.com/irisagent-deflector.js"
  data-api-key="YOUR_IRIS_AGENT_API_KEY"
  defer>
</script>
```

5. Replace `YOUR_IRIS_AGENT_API_KEY`in the above code with your key by going to the [Configure page](https://web.irisagent.com/manage-chatbot) on IrisAgent dashboard
6. Now that the IrisAgent search bar is going to be displayed, the default Zendesk search bar can be deleted from the code. To make the deletion, remove the entire `<div class="search-container">` and all the code inside the div.

## Save, preview, and verify

After adding the script, confirm that the deflector behaves correctly before publishing:

1. Click Save in the theme editor, then use the Zendesk preview to load the new request page
2. Enter a test subject and description; the deflector should surface suggested answers before the ticket is actually submitted
3. Once you are satisfied with the behavior and styling, click Publish changes so the deflector goes live on your production support form
