## **Introduction**

\
IrisAgent's AI Search can power a quick and summarized AI answer along with the search results on your website. This makes your simple search more intelligent by directly answering questions instead of just providing links to articles. This can reduce the number of tickets customers open.

## **Getting Started and Integration Guide**

1. Go to **Configure** page under **IrisGPT** to configure and embed the AI Search.

2. Paste the code snippet shown under the AI Search section in the **body** section of your website.

   ```
    <div id="iris-widget"></div>
    <script src="https://chatbot.irisagent.com/scripts/widget.iife.js"></script>
    <script>
      window.IrisSearchWidget.render({
      apiKey: <API_KEY>,
      container: '#iris-widget',
      });
    </script>
   ```
5. That’s it, done! You should be seeing the AI Search widget on your website.
