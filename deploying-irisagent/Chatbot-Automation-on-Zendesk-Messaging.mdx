This guide walks you through setting up the Zendesk Sunshine Conversations (aka Zendesk Messaging) integration with IrisAgent.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Conversations integration, you must have **Messaging for Web** configured in your Zendesk account. This integration requires a functioning Web Widget to communicate with your customers.

### Setting Up Messaging for Web

If you haven't already set up messaging, follow the official Zendesk guide: [Getting started with messaging for your website, help center, and mobile apps](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408827701530-Getting-started-with-messaging-for-your-website-help-center-and-mobile-apps)

![Messaging Setup](messaging.png)

**Key steps:**

1. Create a messaging channel (automatically enabled in your account)
2. Configure and customize your Web Widget appearance
3. Install the Web Widget code on your website or help center
4. Set up ticket routing and agent access

## Step 1: Create a Conversations Integration

Create a new Conversations integration to establish a bidirectional connection between Zendesk and IrisAgent.

\*\*Follow the official guide: \*\* [Creating conversations integrations in Admin Center](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4576083789850-Creating-conversations-integrations-in-Admin-Center)

### Configuration Steps

1. In Zendesk Admin Center, navigate to **Apps and integrations** \> **Integrations** \> **Conversations integrations**
2. Click **Create integration** and give it a descriptive name (e.g., "IrisAgent Integration")
3. Configure the webhook settings:

**Webhook Configuration:**

- **Target URL**: `https://api1.irisagent.com/v1/webhooks/zendesk`
- **Event Subscriptions**: Select the following events:
  - ✅ `conversation:create` (Conversation created)
  - ✅ `conversation:message` (Conversation message)

4. Click **Save** to create the integration

### Record Integration Credentials

After saving, you'll need to collect the following information:

| Credential         | Description                                  | Where to Find                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **App ID**         | Identifies your Zendesk account              | Integration details page                   |
| **Integration ID** | Unique identifier for this integration       | Integration details page                   |
| **Webhook ID**     | Identifier for the webhook configuration     | Integration details page                   |
| **Shared secret**  | Authentication password for webhook requests | Integration details page (shown only once) |

⚠️ **Important:** The shared secret is shown only once. Copy and store it securely before leaving the page.

## Step 2: Generate API Keys

API keys provide authentication credentials for making API calls to Sunshine Conversations.

### Creating API Keys

1. In your Conversations integration, navigate to the **API Keys** tab
2. Click **Create API key** and give it a descriptive name
3. After creation, click on the key to view the credentials dialog

### Record API Credentials

Copy and store the following values:

| Credential     | Description                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **App ID**     | Your Zendesk account identifier (same as above) |
| **Key ID**     | Used with the secret key for authentication     |
| **Secret key** | Authentication password for API requests        |

⚠️ **Important:** The secret key is shown only once. Copy and store it securely before closing the dialog.

## Step 3: Configure IrisAgent

Now that you have all the required credentials, configure IrisAgent to connect with your Zendesk Sunshine Conversations.

1. Navigate to the IrisAgent account management page: https://web.staging.irisagent.com/manage-accounts

![IrisAgent Manage Accounts](managepage.png)

2. Select **Zendesk Sunshine configs** from the integration options
3. Enter all the credentials you collected:
   - App ID
   - Integration ID
   - Webhook ID
   - Shared secret
   - Key ID
   - Secret key
4. Click **Save** to complete the setup

---

## Verification

After completing the setup:

1. Send a test message through your Web Widget
2. Verify that the conversation appears in your Zendesk Agent Workspace
3. Confirm that IrisAgent is receiving and processing the conversation events

If you encounter any issues, verify that:

- All credentials are entered correctly
- The webhook events (`conversation:create` and `conversation:message`) are properly selected
- Your Zendesk account has the required permissions (Suite Professional plan or above)
