## What is IrisAgent?

IrisAgent is a leader in customer support automation with AI-powered answers, tagging, and workflows that boosts agent productivity and automates tickets at scale. Self-learning and self-configuring AI Agents for chat, email, and voice to scale with your needs.

Our AI Agents improve resolution times by 10x, deflect over 50% of chats, tickets, and calls, and reduce escalations by 60% with highly accurate AI insights without hallucinations.

### AI Agents & Copilots: Instant, Intelligent Answers with context

Save agents’ time and effort by automating responses to common, repetitive tickets. IrisGPT, a GPT-powered chatbot and AI answering engine, can scan your data repository to resolve customer issues without human interaction.

- Automatically analyze previous tickets and knowledge base articles using our AI-powered resolution recommendation engine to identify and suggest appropriate responses.
- Automate responses to common “how to” tickets using our no-code tools.
- Automated workflows based on AI-powered tagging.

### Automatic tagging, sentiment analysis, and trend detection

AI to instantly surface key issues, themes, trends, and sentiment in customer conversations. No more manual categorization—just actionable insights, delivered automatically. Our AI also analyzes tickets for language cues that reveal sentiment. IrisAgent automatically:

- Routes tickets to the right agent based on their domain and expertise.
- Prioritizes tickets based on urgency and business impact.
- Detects sentiment behind tickets to identify at-risk customers.
- Uses built-in analytics to identify those product features with the most negative reactions so support and product teams can better understand the source of the most 'how-to' tickets.
- Helps agents tailor conversations to the customer's product adoption journey and deeply empathize with their experiences – with the customer’s churn risk score, priority level and renewal dates at your agents’ fingertips.

### AI-generated Knowledge Base from Solved Cases

Turn solved cases into a powerful knowledge base – automatically. Close the knowledge gap.

- Automated knowledge article generation from solved cases
- KB gap analysis to identify outdated or missing content

### Resolve tickets with real-time product and user context

Link  tickets with bugs, logs, and alerts from DevOps tools – Jira, PagerDuty, Datadog, Slack and others – to add context and prevent unnecessary engineering escalations. IrisAgent helps agents:

- Understand the true source of issues in real-time directly within your ticketing system.
- Avoid delays caused by duplicative escalations by automatically consolidating similar tickets into a single escalation.
