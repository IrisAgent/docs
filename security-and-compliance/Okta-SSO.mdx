# **Okta Sign-in Guide for Zendesk**

## **Introduction**

\
IrisAgent supports SAML-based sign-in flow with Okta. This guide will help you integrate Okta with IrisAgent using SAML.

## **Okta SAML Integration**

### **Step 1: Create a new SAML application in Okta**

1. Follow the [Okta guide](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_saml.htm) to create a new SAML application.
2. Get the value of TENANT_ID from your point of contact at IrisAgent and then set the following values for the application:
   - Single sign-on URL: `https://frontend-api-server-v2.api.irisagent.com/oauth/okta/TENANT_ID/saml/acs`
   - Audience URI (SP Entity ID): `https://frontend-api-server-v2.api.irisagent.com/oauth/okta/TENANT_ID/saml/metadata`
   - Attribute Statements:
     - `email` -\> `user.email`
     - `name` -\> `user.firstName + " " + user.lastName`

### **Step 3: Connect with Zendesk (or any other ticketing system that you use)**

\
A Zendesk user (with`write`access) in your team should follow the instructions provided [here](https://irisagent.com/zd-docs/) to connect IrisAgent to your Zendesk account. Ensure that this user is assigned to the SAML application of IrisAgent from your Okta dashboard.

### **Step 4: Notify IrisAgent**

Inform IrisAgent [by email](mailto:contact@irisagent.com)once the metadata has been provided and the connection with Zendesk is established.

### **Step 5: Sign in to IrisAgent**

After IrisAgent confirms that your account is set up, you can sign in to IrisAgent from the "My Apps" page of your Okta dashboard.

### **Step 6: Invite more users to IrisAgent**

Your Okta admin can add more users by assigning them to the IrisAgent SAML app in Okta. In addition, please add these users by navigating to "Manage Users" page on [IrisAgent Dashboard.](https://web.irisagent.com/)
