## **Introduction**

\
[Macros in Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408844187034-Creating-macros-for-repetitive-ticket-responses-and-actions) are a great way to help agents address repetitive customer queries and automate workflows. Utilizing agent tools within Zendesk's administrative features allows for the creation, customization, and management of macros, which significantly reduces the need for agents to manually respond to repetitive queries. However, as [support operations](https://irisagent.com/blog/five-ways-to-improve-customer-support-operations/) scale and complexity increases, the number of macros also grows. IrisAgent has worked with companies that have large support operations and understand the frustration this causes for agents, namely,

- Which macro to select? Wrong selections lead to incorrect troubleshooting, longer handle times and poort customer service.
- Newer agents find navigating macros very difficult.
- Hard to train on all macros and select the right one in real-time.

\
IrisAgent solves this with AI - IrisAgent AI powered macro auto-selection help agents pick the right macro real-time with very high accuracy. Check out the screenshot below to see how IrisAgent recommends the right macro to apply to a ticket within Zendesk.
