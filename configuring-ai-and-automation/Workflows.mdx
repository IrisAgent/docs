### Create Workflows using drag and drop interface

Agents and supervisors spend manual effort in triaging and resolving issues that may already be known or solved previously. IrisAgent solves this by automated workflows based on AI-powered tagging, AI-based answers to known issues, and configurable actions for ticket assignment and notifications.

1. Go to the **Automations -\> Triggers** page on the [IrisAgent dashboard](https://web.irisagent.com/triggers) and click on the **\+ Create New Trigger** button on the top-right.
2. Select any number of **Conditions** and **Actions** to be included in your trigger automation.
3. Give your trigger a name by clicking on the pencil icon.
4. Click on the **Add New Trigger** button to save the trigger.

### Create Workflows using plain English

You can [configure workflows by describing them in plain English](https://irisagent.com/smart-operating-procedures/) and some examples. IrisAgent will train an AI model to automatically trigger and act on these workflows. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Automations -\> Training** page on the [IrisAgent dashboard](https://web.irisagent.com/automation/categories) and click on the **\+ Create New SmartOp** button on the top.
2. Enter the name, short description, a couple of examples, and actions for AI Agent you want to automate. Click on **Create**
