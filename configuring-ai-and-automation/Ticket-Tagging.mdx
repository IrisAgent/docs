## **Set up Automated Tagging**

\
Tagging tickets is manual, mundane, and error-prone. Tags get obsolete and incorrect tagging results in inaccurate responses and analytics. IrisAgent solves this by AI-driven automated, and self-learning tag management. No manual effort is needed.\
\
This document provides a step-by-step overview of configuring tag automations using IrisAgent. The process involves setting up AI intents for automatic predictions and responses, which can enhance efficiency in handling customer queries.\
\
There are three ways to automate tagging and you can choose any number of them: Fully Automated, Using Existing Tags or Fields, and Configuring Tagging in plain English.

### **Fully Automated**

\
This is enabled by default. IrisAgent automatically predicts tags for incoming tickets based on historical data and trends from your ticketing system. No additional setup is required. You will start seeing tags under the Categories page on the [IrisAgent dashboard](https://web.irisagent.com/overview).

### **Using Existing Tags or Fields**

\
If your ticketing platform already has the tags or custom fields that your team is manually adding and you'd like to automate, IrisAgent can train an AI model to automatically predict the same tags and write them back into your ticketing system. To do this, please let us know by [sending us an email](mailto:contact@irisagent.com?subject=Existing%20tags%20to%20automate). Include the names of these tags or custom fields in your message.

### **Configuring Tagging in plain English**

\
You can configure new tags by describing them in plain English and some examples. IrisAgent will train an AI model to automatically predict these tags and write them back into your ticketing system. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Automations -\> Training** page on the [IrisAgent dashboard](https://web.irisagent.com/automation/categories) and click on the **\+ Create New Intent** button on the top.
2. Enter the name, short description, and a couple of examples for the Tags you want to automate. Click on **Create**
