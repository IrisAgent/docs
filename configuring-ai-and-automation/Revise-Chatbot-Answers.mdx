## Revise Chatbot Answers

Train your chatbot to give better responses by revising AI answers directly from the IrisAgent dashboard. When the chatbot provides an answer that could be improved, you can update it in just a few clicks—no code required.

## Overview

The **Revise** feature allows you to:

- Review chatbot conversations in real-time
- Edit AI responses that need improvement
- Train the chatbot to provide your revised answer for similar future questions
- Maintain consistent, on-brand messaging across all customer interactions

<Info>
  Revised answers are applied immediately. The next time a customer asks a similar question, the chatbot will use your updated response.

## How It Works

When you revise an answer, you're creating a training rule that tells IrisGPT how to respond to specific types of questions. You can either provide a **Direct Answer** (the exact response you want) or give **Instructions for AI Agent** (guidelines for how the AI should formulate its response).

---

## Step 1: Ask a Question in the Chatbot

Start by identifying an AI response that needs improvement. You can do this by:

- Testing the chatbot yourself with sample questions
- Reviewing recent customer conversations

For example, type a question like "What is AutoKB?" into the IrisAgent chatbot and observe the response you receive.

## Step 2: Open the Conversations Tab

In the IrisAgent dashboard, navigate to **IrisGPT → Conversations** where recent chatbot interactions are listed.

Locate the conversation containing the question you want to revise (e.g., "What is AutoKB?"). Click on the conversation to view the full exchange.

---

## Step 3: Open the Revise Answer View

Within the conversation detail view, you'll see the question and the AI's response. Look for the **Revise** button in the bottom-right corner of the AI answer.

Click **Revise** to open the answer editor.

## Step 4: Edit and Save the New Answer

You'll now see the revision editor with two tabs:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Direct Answer">
    Use this option to provide the exact response you want the chatbot to give. This is best for:

    - Specific factual information
    - Standard responses with precise wording
    - Answers that should always be consistent

    Simply type your improved answer in the text editor. You can use formatting options like **bold**, _italic_, links, and lists.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Instructions for AI Agent">
    Use this option to give the AI guidelines on how to respond. This is best for:

    - Answers that may need slight variations
    - Responses that should incorporate real-time context
    - Guidelines on tone, length, or structure
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Optional:** Add training examples by entering additional query text or ticket IDs. This helps the AI recognize variations of the same question.

When you're satisfied with your changes, click **Save** to apply the revision.

---

## Step 5: Test the Updated Answer in the Chatbot

Return to the chatbot interface and ask the same question again (e.g., "What is AutoKB?").

Confirm that the chatbot now responds with exactly the revised answer you configured.

<Check>
  **Success!** Your chatbot is now trained to provide the improved response for this type of question.

## Managing Revised Answers

All your revisions are saved as training rules. To view or edit existing revisions:

1. Navigate to **Automation → Training** in the sidebar
2. Browse your list of training rules
3. Click any rule to edit or delete it

<Tip>
  Regularly review your training rules to ensure they stay up-to-date with your product and policies.
